  ** Motivation
  I'm collecting my experience here in a good looking format, it is worth sharing. \\
  This guide could be useful for the people who want to install Arch Linux, \\
  also for individuals who desire lightweight and manual system with window manager or more automated but heavy desktop environment like GNOME or KDE. \\
