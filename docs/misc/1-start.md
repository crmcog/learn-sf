# Misc. Information

The course content was originally created by Prashanth Krishnamurthy, who maintains CRM technology blog at [crmcog](https://crmcog.com). sf-monkey was intended to aid teachers and standardize salesforce.com learning in a closed environment, but released to the wild when it was found to be (moderately) useful amongst the select group of individuals and companies.
