Salesforce.com is considered the leader and ranked at the top for enterprise application development and low-code/no-code platforms. It should certainly be considered in your list of platforms to learn and prepare yourself for a future career in technology (or business, depending on what you are doing).

We introduced the Salesforce for Students guide to provide a shorter ramp-up plan, and equip students (or whoever is interested in this way of learning) with the basic tools to quickly create something. We believe that doing so will further interest in the platform and lead to more exploratory learning later on.

## Why Salesforce should be an option for students?

The typical focus on programming languages in schools and colleges is good, but will not completely prepare today's students for the real-world software development. As a student, you might often find yourself deciding between type of developer you want to become, choosing amongst multitude of technologies and platforms, or just trying to launch an app that you want to showcase to the world.

Salesforce should certainly be one of the platforms that you need to consider. It offers a good career option today, is generally perceived to have a bright future, and is constantly evolving to include new capabilities sought after by enterprise. Your career in IT/business should be a more straight-forward path with salesforce.com if you are looking at -

- application programming domain: creating web or mobile apps for an enterprise
- technology enablers in form of functional analysts or application administrators
- sales, service or marketing careers (as users)

The future will likely include more of IoT, Artificial Intelligence on Salesforce - but we see that as subsidiary functions for enterprises which have already bought into the salesforce world.

## What salesforce option should I choose?

See [salesforce.com career options](/why-learn-salesforce/salesforce-careers/).

- If you are studying technology - choose **developer** path
- If you are studying for a career in business/ management: choose the **functional analyst** / **core business** path

Still confused? Talk to a professional in the field and to your career counsellor.
