# Course Structure - Salesforce for Students

The course "Salesforce for Students" was primarily targeted at student community, and the focus was to make learning fun and take the students rather quickly to a position where they can develop simple apps. This is counter-intuitive since students don't "go deep" in the technology, but was done to -

1. Retain student interest in the course. We had limited time to teach students and were competing against other courses vying for attention :)
1. The idea is to get them to do something useful fast - much similar to creating useful applications in C#/Java or creating a cool machine learning algorithm

While we feel the objectives are novel, we have to deal with limited time availability too. So, this course and course content are experimental and may have duplicated content.
