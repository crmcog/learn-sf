# Practice Case Studies

## Purpose

This section provides students with a set of case studies in order to familiarise them with the Salesforce.com applications. The case studies provided here are targeted at beginner SFDC developers. They will include â€“

1. Problems
   Expose students to real-world problems. The problems may be documented in business or technical language. Later case studies have user stories that the students need to implement.

2. Solution hints
   Help students move towards determining possible solutions, design solutions, and implement them.

3. Activities and tasks
   Series of activities and tasks that the case studies demand.

4. References
   Occasionally, point students to resources in the training materials or on the web.

5. Guidance by Instructors
   It is recommended to have instructors handy to answer any queries! You can use standard templates to document solutions, design a solution, and document/present it to an audience (typically other learners).

## Instructions

- Case studies are typically attempted at the end of the course
- Discuss solutions with your instructors and other groups. Do not copy solutions to maximise learning
- Bring your unique perspective to the problem, and solutions
- Your approach to problem solving is more important than the final solution
- Plan to present options, design and implemented solution to the assessment panel and a select audience

On the technical front -

- Create a distinct developer org for case studies (unless it is a Trailhead project, in which case a Trailhead-only environment should suffice)
