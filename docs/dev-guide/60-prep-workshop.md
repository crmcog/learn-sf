# Workshop Conclusion

Test prep discussion is intended as a classroom activity if you are doing this self-study within an organisation framework, form a community within your organisation.

If you are going solo, you can form communities for discussing your questions on the exam on any social media platform. Or just ask away them questions on [Salesforce Admin Trailblazers](https://success.salesforce.com/featuredGroupDetail?id=a1z3A000008Ct8bQAC), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/), or any of the tens of websites who are focused on providing admin help!
