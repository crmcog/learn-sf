- Map any functions to existing Salesforce functions or create new
- Identify your tasks, and create an Excel sheet, Kanban board or a simple project plan

#### Develop

- Create user stories
- Create process diagram for various user groups and high-level design
- Create the app on Salesforce
- Test the application and document results

Create the app in your existing Salesforce org. Create at least 10 sample data points for the presentation.

Test results should match records in the app – do not modify records once tested.

#### Present

Present your application.

- Presentation should call out the in and out of scope items
- How did you plan to build this out? What went right and what could have gone well?
- Your design, process flow, and parties with access to your systems
- Your view of support from AppExchange for the given business problem
- Role of salesforce in enabling a system that is outside the “normal” CRM flow
