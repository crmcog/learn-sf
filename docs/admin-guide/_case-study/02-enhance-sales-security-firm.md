#### Scenario

WatchDawg Inc. has been in the professional security business for more than five years. They specialise in providing security cams for businesses and homes. WatchDawg does business only in Canada, but has future expansion plans for the US and Mexico.
Recenly, WatchDawg has entered into an agreement with Google Inc. to provide Nest Hello device. They also have had some success in representing security agencies in the past, and they want to take this opportunity to offer security guard services for both office and domestic customers.
WatchDawg uses Salesforce.com Sales Cloud for the country wide sales tracking, and are looking up to you to advise them and quickly implement changes for the two new LoBs. Key business objectives are –

1. Offer the new product and service to existing and new customers
2. Capture orders and make them distinct from opportunities. The current model is not efficient enough for tracking
3. Acquire leads through the small office directory of Canada
4. Capture key additional attributes from customers
   - Is there manned security currently?
   - If yes, name of security agency
   - Number of floors
   - Number of doors monitored by security cams vs. no. of doors on premise
   - Square area
   - Capture whether the house owner/ decision maker is a friendly
5. Enable reps to start selling quickly. Track leads and opportunities more closely. Increase volume of high value customers by offering larger discounts, that need to be approved by regional managers
6. Provide automated sales reports to MDs for new products and services
7. Business is also looking forward to clean up the role hierarchy of their sales teams and divide them sole based on regions (and nothing else)
   - They currently have CEO -> MD (North, South, East, West) -> Provincial / Regional Manager -> Sales Manager -> Sales Rep roles defined, but not strictly adhered to

You discuss with the manager, and have identified the following key objectives -

1. Create new product that will be sourced from Google. It has a cost, list price tagged to it.
2. Create a new service product that will have a subscription-type pricing model. The two distinct services offered are 12x7 and 24x7.
3. Clean up role hierarchy so that they are aligned to the org hierarchy and the specific regions
4. Capture additional attributes against customer records
5. Enable reps to capture orders for all products
6. Create approval flow for large discounts (greater than \$20,000)
7. Generate and provide reports for the regional performance
8. Report out value of total opportunities captured by WatchDawg reps vs. closed opportunities

#### Prepare

- Analyse the findings from your discussion with the manager to determine the changes.
- Create a process diagram and a high-level design

#### Develop

- Create the app in your existing Salesforce org.
- Create at least 10 sample data points for the presentation.

#### Present

Present your applications along with your thoughts on-

- Managing products, pricebooks
- Opportunities and orders – similarities and differences
- How will you get customer references from Google?
- Will it better if you are on the partner portal enabled on Google rather than creating your own sales engine?
