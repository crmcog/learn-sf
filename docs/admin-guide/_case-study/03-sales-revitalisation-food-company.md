#### Scenario

MD & Company is headquartered in Bangalore. It is known for its packaged foods including –

1. Good Potato Chips
2. Better Tapioca
3. Good Noodles
4. Good Coco Cookies

MD has generated moderate interest in South India with its products, but a lot of its operations are in Karnataka alone. MD operates through a chain of distributors, large retail and wholesale chains including Big Bazaar, Nilgiris, and Metro.

MD wants to improve its prospects in South India in the next one year. It has drawn up an aggressive plan to recruit more sales reps in four Southern states, revitalize the IT systems to provide a good base for future country expansion, and grow top-line revenue by at least 20% YoY.

The Sales Director has asked for your assistance to create a Salesforce based system for their sales reps and managers. He has laid down the following high-level objectives for you to think through and suggest future course of action.

1. Implement a common system for sales reps and managers. The system should scale for Distributors in the future
2. Create a sales organization that starts from Chief Sales Officer, Sales Director, State Sales Leads, Zone Sales Leads and Sales Reps. Seamlessly share data between the different groups, but let them focus on the data that is relevant to them
3. Reps should be able to access past and future business prospects of large retail and wholesale chains, but are not interested in seeing Distributors who are local to specific zones
4. Reps should be able to create and manage opportunities, create leads, accounts and contacts, and track their activities on a calendar
5. Reps should be notified of any changes to account and contact information of large chains
6. Managers should be able to see their subordinate calendars, and customer records to back them up in case of non-availability
7. Managers must get summary reports of performance –
   - Opportunities created, open and closed in reporting period (weekly)
   - Sales performance history (quarterly)
8. Deals that are less than Rs. 25,000 should be reviewed by State Sales Leads
9. Distributors must be kept notified on the opportunities that have reached negotiation stage to seek their inputs
10. Distributors must be notified about closure of opportunities within a day of closure
11. The application must be available on mobile and through browser to enable reps and managers to access and update information on the go
