#### Scenario

IABD Inc is a technology service company that works with customers in three regions across the globe. IABD provides technology implementation services on Mainframe, Java and HTML/Javascript.

The company was moderately successful in the ten years of existence, but it shot to fame with a recent acquisition of Wow DevOps Inc. The deeper knowledge about DevOps and the reliability of IABD combined to create a good market buzz for IABD and resulted in an unheard of 15% YoY revenue growth.

Excited by the outcome, the CEO has decided to scout for potential acquisitions in the same league as Wow DevOps. IABD already uses Salesforce.com sales solution to keep track of sales and the CEO was interested to know what else Salesforce could do for her. She has asked you, the humble but proud SFDC admin, on what could be potentially done to create a process around evaluation of companies for acquisitions and mergers.

Although CEO has not provided any documented rules, you have made your observations and got them validated by business –

1. There is an interim consultant brought in to provide consulting services for evaluating potential acquisitions. He is referred to as “M&A Consultant”
2. M&A consultant evaluates market presence of companies in the same regions as IABD, creates an overview of business model and revenue
3. Potential candidates are sent for approval to country MD. After the regional MD, either one of CEO and CFO need to mandatorily approve the deal. CEO or CFO do not login to Salesforce, but MD may also want to track progress within the system
4. M&A consultant consults with his own company consultants in the three regions, and gets intel on ground. He typically does not document them but has meeting notes in OneNote
5. Due to sensitive nature of the deal, the information is not shared to MDs or any other leaders in IABD
6. M&A consultant proceeds to organize meetings with the target company leadership and sets a plan in motion
7. M&A consultant accompanies MD/CEO on further meetings and negotiations. He is responsible to keep the tracking system updated.
8. The M&A deal is thereon closed or cancelled depending on the outcome of negotiations – this can take up to 3 months.
9. A closure or cancellation mail has to go to MD, CEO and CFO
10. A 'thank you' mail is sent to the CEO/designated leader from the candidate company – regardless of outcome. Contacts must be deactivated if the deal does not go through
11. Any expenses for M&A are logged against the deal. CFO is particular about expenses being within the acquisition budget for the year
12. Monthly reports have to be sent to CEO, CFO and MD on the status of M&A, budget and expenses

#### Prepare

- List the processes (preferably in a process flow) and map them to stakeholders
- Create high-level design
- Identify the Salesforce components that you need to use

#### Develop

- Create the app in your existing Salesforce org.
- Create at least 10 sample data points for the presentation.
- Test results should match records in the app – do not modify records once tested.

#### Present

- Presentation should call out the in and out of scope items
- How did you plan to build this out? What went right and what could have gone well?
- Your design, process flow, and parties with access to your systems
- Your view of support from AppExchange for the given business problem
- Enabling access to third parties – what are your thoughts and final decision
- Working with partners (& other third party). When should they have access to Salesforce?
- Your defined role-hierarchy
- Email templates and email communication – your options and final implementation. What are the steps you can take to avoid sending emails during your testing?
- Role of salesforce in enabling a system that is outside the “normal” CRM flow
