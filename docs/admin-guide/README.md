# Admin Certification Guide: Get Started

Being an admin is exciting. You get to control the destiny of Salesforce implementation through more than a few tasks -

- Manage data security
- Make life easier for everyone through automation
- Enforce business validation
- Manage reporting
- Help users maximise benefits by monitoring usage patterns and identifying things that work good or otherwise
- Monitor system health

## Prerequisites

To be an admin is not just about technology, but also about being the person ever ready to help! There are not many prerequisites except basic knowledge about computers and Internet.

So.. anyone can do this!

- Ability to work on a browser
- Analytical skills will certainly help
- Willingness to explore :)
- Able to spend at least 1-2 hours a day for a month

From a system perspective, you need to have the following -

- Stable Internet connection and a laptop/desktop
- Standards compliant browser. Chrome recommended (of course!)
- Water to help you stay hydrated

## Objective

The objective of this course is to outline Salesforce capabilities that you need to know in order to become an admin. Since Admin Certification (ADM201) is a quantifiable measure of admin knowledge, we use that as a reference point.

Note that Salesforce recommends actual experience as an admin to attempt ADM201 exam. In our experience though - you stand an excellent chance to complete the exam successfully even with lesser experience iff -

- you start with some application knowledge
- go through a structured learning process
- apply your knowledge in workshops
- solve case studies
- get mentored by admins / Salesforce professionals in the process

## Duration

This course has been split into ~15 lessons. There is no strict guidelines on the number of days, but we have typically seen the lessons taught at an average rate of 0.5 to 1 lesson per day. This includes -

- Teaching a class of ~10-15 students for 2 hours / day. Note that these students would typically have a strong technical background before they begin, so your mileage may vary a bit
- Let students apply their knowledge during rest of the time

It is not uncommon to see people not being able to complete their assignments (what we call ALWs = Applied Learning Workshops), but they tend to catch up as we progress.
