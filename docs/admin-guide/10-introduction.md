# Introduction

## Workshop

Workshop section in a chapter/lesson provides a set of activities that the students need to do after the theory and practice classes for individual lessons in the Salesforce Admin course.

The intent is to provide -

1. get students to "do stuff" at the end of each chapter
1. practical, real-world problems: Outline business scenarios and specific problem statements that require students to apply their salesforce.com learning (well, to 'some' extent)
1. solution details: Provide high level design elements to solve afore-said problems.

**Instructions**

1. Discuss problems/solutions with your instructor(s) in case of any queries
2. Complete the activities before bringing in your unique perspectives and/or solutions to the problem

**Outcome**

The problems provided are expected to incrementally build the complexity of your application as you progress. You will be a better admin, IT analyst or developer who can analyse a problem, think through possible solutions, and identify & implement changes on salesforce.com platform.

Introductions done, let's see the tasks at hand for this chapter.
