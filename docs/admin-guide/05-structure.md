# Course Structure - Admin Certification

Here's a structure of all the learning that you have to do in the journey to become a smart Salesforce admin. While the Internet has all the content that you can imagine and Salesforce Trailhead does a good job of organising it for admins, we often felt the need for a more "ah-i-get-it" structure that is also easy to teach students from non-Salesforce background.

So, here's an opinionated learning structure that contains all of the great content, but organised differently. We have created presentation guides for teachers (you will find them under **Teaching Aids** section under each chapter) and that reflects the same structure as well.

The structure outlined below has been applied in dozens of classes - so you can be rest assured that the "thing" works. But, we are always listening to new ideas. We understand if this way of teaching/understanding Salesforce does work for you, but appreciate if you could tell us your opinion!
