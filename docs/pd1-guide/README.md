# PD1 Certification Guide: Get Started

Being a Salesforce developer is, for lack of a better word, cool. You not only create magic through apps and customizing implementations, but do it in a way that scales to thousands of users at no additional development cost.

There are significant benefits for being a Salesforce developer -

- No-code and low-code technologies are the future. Salesforce is a pioneer and leader in the space and enjoys trust by thousands of companies
- SFDC is changing for the better and improving all the time. Developers get opportunities to learn new skills and deliver better business value for their applications
- Develop skills to focus on business problems and deploy the right mix of configuration and customisation options
- Focus on application not on infrastructure

## Prerequisites

Although almost anyone with technology knowledge/background can start on this course, it may be helpful if you have exposure to Salesforce.com.

- Salesforce.com administrators
- Technology professionals and students who already know a bit of Salesforce and do not have any trouble understanding the app structure
- Familiarity with other programming languages will help, but not required
- Able to spend at least 1-2 hours a day for a month

From a system perspective, you need to have the following -

- Stable Internet connection and a laptop/desktop
- Standards compliant browser. Chrome recommended (of course!)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Salesforce extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode)
- Water to help you stay hydrated

## Objective

The objective of this course is to outline the basic knowledge needed to be acquired by a Salesforce developer. The PD1 certification itself is used as a quantifiable reference point and nothing more. By going through this course, you should have enough knowledge to -

- create a Salesforce app
- implement configuration changes
- implement business automation and validations using a slew of configuration/customisation options

Note that Salesforce recommends actual experience as an admin to attempt PD1 exam. You stand a good chance to complete the exam successfully even with lesser experience iff -

- you have a strong technology background
- go through a structured learning process
- apply your knowledge in workshops
- solve case studies
- get mentored by Salesforce developers

## Duration

This course has been split into ~13 lessons. There are no strict guidelines on the number of days, but we have typically seen the lessons taught at an average rate of 0.5 to 1 lesson per day. This includes -

- Teaching a class of ~10-15 students for 2 hours / day
- Let students apply their knowledge during rest of the time

It is not uncommon to see people not being able to complete their assignments (what we call ALWs = Applied Learning Workshops), but they tend to catch up as we progress.
