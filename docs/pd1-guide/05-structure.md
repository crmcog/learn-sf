# Course Structure - PD I Certification

Here's a structure of all the learning that you have to do in the journey to become a sought-after Salesforce developer. As always, this is our narrow view of how content can be organised for a structured study - there is no one right answer.

You will also find presentation guides created for teachers and to an extent self-learners - look for **Teaching Aids** section under each chapter.

The structure outlined below has been applied in dozens of classes - so you can be rest assured that the "thing" works. But, we are always listening to new ideas. We understand if this way of teaching/understanding Salesforce does work for you, but appreciate if you could tell us your opinion!
