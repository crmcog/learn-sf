scenario:
  WatchDawg Inc. has been in the professional security business for more than five years. They specialise in providing security cams for businesses and homes. WatchDawg does business only in Canada, but has future expansion plans for the US and Mexico.

  Recently, WatchDawg has entered into an agreement with Google Inc. to provide Nest Hello device. They also have had some success in representing security agencies in the past, and they want to take this opportunity to offer security guard services for both office and domestic customers.

  WatchDawg uses Salesforce.com Sales Cloud for the country wide sales tracking, and are looking up to you to advise them and quickly implement changes for the two new LoBs. Key business objectives are â€“
  1. Offer the new product and service to existing and new customers
  2. Capture orders and make them distinct from opportunities. The current model is not efficient enough for tracking
  3. Acquire leads through the small office directory of Canada
  4. Capture key additional attributes from customers
  a. Is there manned security currently?
  b. If yes, name of security agency
  c. Number of floors
  d. Number of doors monitored by security cams vs. no. of doors on premise
  e. Square area
  f. Capture whether the house owner/ decision maker is a friendly
  5. Enable reps to start selling quickly. Track leads and opportunities more closely. Increase volume of high value customers by offering larger discounts, that need to be approved by regional managers
  6. Provide automated sales reports to MDs for new products and services
